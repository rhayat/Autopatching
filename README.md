1. This project identifies the vulnerability provided in the diff file, generates a proof of vulnerability file and then generates a diff file to patch that vulnerability without a change in functionality.
2. The required repo for running this file is the aixcc-sample-challenge. The python file copies the repo to the home directory
3. The aixcc-sample-challenge contains the diff file, so there is no need to provide the diff seperately
